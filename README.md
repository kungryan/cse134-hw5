I added sound effects to various buttons throughout the page to hopefully make the page feel a bit more lively. 
I also tried to adjust the mobile layout to make it more compact and easy to use with sticky positioning. 
I added some extra colors to also help make the page pop out better and hopefully feel less monotonous.
Because I do emphasize that I like gaming, I added a silly little minigame to my homepage where if JS is enabled and theyre on a desktop (at least 1281px view), they can click on space invaders to get some points, which hopefully also helps my page feel more personalable.
