                <h2>Mobile Hamburger Menu with only CSS (and HTML)</h2>
                <p>
                    The second part of this portfolio was to style it with some CSS. In addition to the overall asethetic, flexboxes, and custom fonts, one of
                    the things I was tasked with exploring was responsive design. I used a fluid type scale calculator provided by 
                    <cite><a href="https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator">Utopia.fyi</a></cite> to have the text feel more fluid and responsive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing I utilized were breakpoints to determine the layout of the header for desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. For my mobile layout, I first tried a grid display
                    with 2 columns, but it felt rather clunky and space inefficient. This is when I decided to look into making a typical mobile hamburger menu
                    that you'd normally see on everyday sites. However, I wasn't supposed to use any JavaScript for this part which meant I had to make this menu
                    with pure CSS (and HTML of course). Of course, there are already quite a few examples out there, so I knew this was possible. The one that I
                    particularly liked and used as inspiration is by Janessa Garrow, of which you can find 
                    <a href="https://janessagarrow.com/blog/pure-css-hamburger-menu/">here</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>The HTML</h3>
<pre><code>&ltheader&gt
        &lth2&gt...&lt/h2&gt
        &ltmenu-button&gt
                &ltinput type="checkbox" id="menuButton" name="menuButton"&gt
                &ltlabel for="menuButton"&gt
                        &ltsvg&gt
                                ⋮
                        &ltsvg&gt
                &lt/label&gt
        &lt/menu-button&gt
        &ltnav&gt
                ⋮
        &lt/nav&gt
&lt/header&gt
</code></pre>
                <p>The HTML itself is very basic with a heading and a nav tag. I use a custom tag menu-button, for semantic purposes, to serve as the wrapper for 
                    the hamburger menu. I use an checkbox input to serves as a way to keep track of the state of whether or not the user has opened/closed the menu.
                    The label is wrapped around the SVG that draws the hamburger icon so that pressing on the SVG will also trigger the checkbox. However, we don't want
                    to actually show the checkbox itself and we want to make sure that we only display the menu for mobile layouts, to which brings us to the CSS portion.
